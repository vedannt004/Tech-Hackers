# 🚀 GovGenie – Empowering Citizens to Report Civic Issues

**Team Name:** Tech Hackers 
**Project Title:** GovGenie – A Real-Time Civic Issue Reporting Platform

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In many cities and neighborhoods, civic issues like potholes, water leakage, garbage dumps, or broken street lights go **unreported** or **ignored** due to lack of a centralized reporting system. Citizens have no easy way to report problems, and authorities struggle to identify which issues to prioritize.

**GovGenie** addresses this by providing a platform where:
- Citizens can easily **report issues** with photo and location.
- The public can **upvote** issues that matter most.
- Authorities can track and resolve problems efficiently.

## 💡 Project Overview

GovGenie is a **web-based solution** that connects the public with civic authorities in real-time. It encourages transparency, accountability, and engagement by enabling users to:
- Submit issue reports with photos, titles, and descriptions.
- View all issues across neighborhoods.
- Upvote important issues to help authorities prioritize them.
- Track the status of submitted issues (Submitted → In Progress → Resolved).
